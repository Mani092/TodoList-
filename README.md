## Developing of the application

I used Getx,MVC architecture,sharedpreferences,flutter_local_notification.

For statemangement I used Getx .

For the priority (High ,medium,low) is used sorting.

For the remainder I used the flutter_local_notification 30 mi before the end of the deadline as to give a quick remainder for the user and another push notification as the deadline ends.

I used shared prefernces to save the data of the user.
